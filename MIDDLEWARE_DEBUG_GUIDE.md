# üîß Middleware Debug Guide

## üéØ **Changes Made to Fix the Issue**

### 1. **Simplified Middleware Logic**

- Removed complex redirect logic that was causing loops
- Only protect `/app` routes, let everything else pass through
- Redirect to `/auth/signin` instead of home page for better UX

### 2. **Enhanced NextAuth Configuration**

- Added proper cookie configuration for production
- Set secure cookies for production environment
- Added session and JWT maxAge settings
- Enabled debug mode for development

### 3. **Better Error Handling**

- Added try-catch blocks to prevent middleware crashes
- Graceful fallback to signin page on errors

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Netlify**

Make sure these are set in your Netlify dashboard:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
DIRECT_URL=your-production-database-url
```

### **Step 2: Deploy Changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix middleware redirect issues"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Test the Fix**

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Try to access `/app` without being logged in
3. Should redirect to `/auth/signin` instead of causing a 307 redirect
4. After logging in, should be able to access `/app` normally

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

### **If you still get 307 redirects:**

1. **Check Netlify Function Logs**:

   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí View logs
   - Look for middleware console.log outputs
   - Check for any errors

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:

   - Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your exact domain
   - Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set and consistent
   - Check that all Google OAuth credentials are correct

3. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Try logging in first
   - Then navigate to `/app`
   - Check if the session is being maintained

### **If authentication fails:**

1. **Check Database Connection**:

   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
   - Test database connectivity

2. **Verify Google OAuth**:

   - Check Google Cloud Console settings
   - Ensure redirect URIs are correct
   - Verify client ID and secret

3. **Check Session Storage**:
   - Look for session cookies in browser dev tools
   - Verify cookies are being set correctly

## üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative Approach (If Still Not Working)**

If the middleware approach still doesn't work, we can try a different approach:

### **Option 1: Remove Middleware Completely**

- Delete the middleware.ts file
- Use client-side authentication checks in components
- Handle redirects in the AuthGuard component

### **Option 2: Use NextAuth Middleware**

- Use NextAuth's built-in middleware instead
- This might be more reliable for production

### **Option 3: Server-Side Authentication**

- Move authentication checks to page components
- Use `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`

## üìù **Expected Behavior After Fix**

‚úÖ **Before Login**:

- Visiting `/app` ‚Üí Redirects to `/auth/signin`
- No 307 redirects
- Clean authentication flow

‚úÖ **After Login**:

- Can access `/app` normally
- Session persists across page refreshes
- Proper logout functionality

‚úÖ **General**:

- No middleware errors in logs
- Clean console output
- Fast page loads

## üö® **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue: Still getting 307 redirects**

**Solution**: Check that `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set correctly and matches your domain exactly

### **Issue: Authentication not working**

**Solution**: Verify all environment variables are set and Google OAuth is configured properly

### **Issue: Middleware errors in logs**

**Solution**: Check that `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set and database connection is working

### **Issue: Session not persisting**

**Solution**: Check cookie settings and ensure secure cookies are configured for production

The key changes should resolve the 307 redirect issue. The simplified middleware approach is more reliable and less prone to redirect loops.
