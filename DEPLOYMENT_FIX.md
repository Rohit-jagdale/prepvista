# üöÄ PrepVista Deployment Fix Guide

## üîç **Issue Identified**

The 307 Temporary Redirect error you're experiencing is caused by:

1. **Netlify Configuration Issue**: The `netlify.toml` had a catch-all redirect that was interfering with Next.js routing
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: `NEXTAUTH_URL` is not set in production, causing authentication to fail

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. Fixed `netlify.toml`

- Removed the problematic catch-all redirect `/*` ‚Üí `/index.html`
- Next.js handles routing internally, so this redirect was causing conflicts
- Added specific favicon redirect instead

### 2. Updated `next.config.js`

- Added `output: 'standalone'` for better deployment
- Made rewrites only apply in development mode
- This prevents localhost rewrites from affecting production

## üîß **Required Environment Variables**

You need to set these environment variables in your Netlify deployment:

### **Critical Variables (Must Set)**

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

### **Database Variables**

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
DIRECT_URL=your-production-database-url
```

### **Optional Variables**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Netlify**

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add all the required variables listed above
4. Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your exact domain (e.g., `https://prepvista.netlify.app`)

### **Step 2: Redeploy**

1. Trigger a new deployment in Netlify
2. Or push the changes to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment redirect issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify Fix**

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Try to access `/app` route
3. The 307 redirect should be resolved
4. Authentication should work properly

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **If you still get redirects:**

1. Check that `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set correctly in Netlify
2. Verify the URL matches your exact domain (no trailing slash)
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Check Netlify function logs for errors

### **If authentication fails:**

1. Verify all Google OAuth credentials are correct
2. Check that database connection is working
3. Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set and consistent

### **If API calls fail:**

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your backend URL
2. Verify CORS is configured on your backend
3. Check that your backend is accessible from the frontend domain

## üìù **Environment Variable Checklist**

- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` = Your exact Netlify domain
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` = Strong secret key
- [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` = From Google Cloud Console
- [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` = From Google Cloud Console
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` = Production database connection
- [ ] `DIRECT_URL` = Same as DATABASE_URL
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = Your backend URL (optional)

## üéØ **Expected Result**

After applying these fixes:

- ‚úÖ No more 307 redirects
- ‚úÖ `/app` route accessible when authenticated
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication flow
- ‚úÖ All API calls working correctly

The main issue was the Netlify redirect configuration interfering with Next.js routing. This should resolve your deployment problem completely.
